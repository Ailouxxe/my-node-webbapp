        <h1>About PTC</h1>
        <p>The partnership between PTC and SCESI ended in October, 1995. Keeping up with the goal to continue its technical-vocational advocacy, PTC forged another linkage, this time with the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP). On September 26, 1995, PTC became the recipient of the Adopt-A-School program of TUP through another Memorandum of Agreement. The linkage gave birth to the first four-year Bachelor of Computer Science program in the academic year 1997 – 1998. PTC also became TUP’s ally in the off-campus training of the latter’s undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
